<h3 align="center">Lead Developer (PHP backend)</h3>

One could best identify me as `(Lead) Product Developer` with a background in `Design`. I am a webdeveloper building software in the cloud. My creative background helps me to find creative solutions for technical problems. I have experience in several different sectors mainly in their growth fase. As a team lead I aim to pay the leadership I had forward. I strive for a safe environment with room to fail and room grow. I will take responsibility when needed and give credit where due. I will stimulate self learning but take all the time to coach and guide through the hard parts.

### My main skills

I've been working almost exclusively in PHP using the Symfony framework. Though the framework was very helpful to learn about OOP, MVC and general bootstrapping it is now fading more and more to be just an infrastructure toolkit to strap your interface / requests to your application. My favourite challenges now are looking at architecture and improving platform stability, scalability and maintainability. This means thinking about business logic, domain contexts and knowing (usually after experiencing!) when to (perhaps NOT) use which techniques or technology.

### Symfony

The back-end framework of my choice is Symfony. I chose Symfony because it is built up of several different open source projects which you can easily swap around. It also provides a very easy way of extending the framework with your own stuff. Symfony has also helped me learn a lot about programming and other systems. Even though Symfony made a lot of things easier, lately i'm challenging myself to not use the entire framework by default but only the needed components. However, it has always been through Symfony that I have been able to grow as a Developer.
